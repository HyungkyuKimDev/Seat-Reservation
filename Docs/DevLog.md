# Dev Log

## 2024/06/23
- I set up the environment for Laravel and React using Docker.
- It wasn't easy for me. There was an issue with the Nginx and Laravel port configuration.
- It took longer than I expected, but I solved it.
- Next time, I will develop the basic concept of this app on the Laravel side.
